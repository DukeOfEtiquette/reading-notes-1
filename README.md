## Growth Mindset, What is it? 

A mindset of growth is simply a mindset that is inspired to keep you learning and moves forward to push past what you thought you could do.

### **Ways You Can Stay in a Growth Mindset**
*  Allow self discovery
*  Understand that failure is a learning tool
*  Appreciate your abiltiy to learn from your mistakes

As I like to say:
> Knowledge is indeed power. 
> The knowledge of *who* you are is the most powerful knowledge *anyone* can attain and the power *in* who you are is absolute.
