## Growth Mindset, What is it? 

A mindset of growth is simply a mindset that give you the ability to keep learning, keep going to keep pushing past what you thought you cold do.

### **Ways You Can Stay in a Growth Mindset**
*  Allow self discovery
*  Understand that failure is a learning tool
*  Appreciate your abiltiy to learn from your mistakes

As I like to say:

Knowledge is indeed power. The knowledge of *who* you are is the most powerful knowledge *anyone* can attain and the power *in* who you are is absolute.
